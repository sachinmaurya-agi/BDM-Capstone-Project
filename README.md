## üéØ Problem Statement

The business faces significant operational challenges that hinder its growth. These problems stem from a reliance on manual processes and intuition-based decisions, combined with external market pressures like seasonal purchasing behavior. This results in three critical issues:

1.  **Significant Revenue Volatility:** Sales are heavily concentrated in festive seasons, leading to unpredictable cash flow and sharp revenue declines during off-season months.
2.  **Inefficient Inventory Management:** The lack of a systematic stocking policy causes overstocking of slow-moving items and stockouts of high-demand products, blocking capital.
3.  **Sub-optimal Transportation Logistics:** A reactive and unplanned delivery process leads to inefficient routes, excessive fuel consumption, and potential service delays.

## üöÄ Project Objectives

To address the problems, this project aims to achieve the following quantifiable goals:

* **Revenue:** Design and validate a strategy to **increase average monthly sales during non-festival seasons by 15%** within six months of implementation.
* **Inventory:** Develop a dynamic inventory model to **reduce overall holding costs by 10%** and **minimize stockouts of key items to less than 5%**.
* **Logistics:** Streamline transportation operations to achieve a **15% reduction in delivery-related costs** and improve the **on-time delivery rate to over 95%**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

A three-pronged analytical approach will be used to tackle each objective.

### 1. Revenue Stabilization
* **Methods:**
    * **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** for customer segmentation and targeted promotions.
    * **Market Basket Analysis** to identify product associations for bundling and cross-selling.
    * **Sales Forecasting** using a Moving Average model to set a performance baseline.
* **Data:** Transactional sales data from July 2024 to July 2025 (Transaction_ID, Customer_ID, Date, Product_SKU, Quantity, Price).

### 2. Inventory Optimization
* **Methods:**
    * **ABC-XYZ Analysis** to create a multi-criteria inventory classification matrix based on revenue contribution and demand volatility.
    * **Reorder Point (ROP) Calculation** to determine optimal stock levels for high-value items.
* **Data:** Historical product sales data, supplier lead times, and item costs from July 2024 to July 2025.

### 3. Logistical Enhancement
* **Methods:**
    * **Grid-Based Zone Analysis** to group daily deliveries into geographical zones.
    * **Nearest Neighbor Heuristic** to determine an efficient delivery sequence within each zone.
    * **Cost-Benefit Analysis** to compare the in-house delivery model against outsourcing.
* **Data:** Delivery logs, vehicle expense reports, and quotes from local logistics providers.
