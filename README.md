## üè¨ About the Business

[cite_start]**Shri Hari Electric And Electronics** is a B2C retail store founded in 2022 by Mr. Santlal Maurya in Mariyahu, Jaunpur[cite: 56, 68]. [cite_start]It serves the local community as a one-stop shop for electronics, furniture, and home wiring supplies[cite: 57, 68]. [cite_start]The store's key differentiator is its unique product mix, catering to customers furnishing existing homes and those building new ones from the ground up[cite: 72, 73].

* [cite_start]**üìç Location:** Mariyahu near Railway Fatak, Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh 222161 [cite: 69]
* [cite_start]**‚è∞ Operating Hours:** 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM daily [cite: 70]
* [cite_start]**üë• Team Size:** 4, including the owner [cite: 70]

## üéØ Problem Statement

The business faces significant operational challenges that hinder its growth. [cite_start]These problems stem from a reliance on manual processes and intuition-based decisions, combined with external market pressures like seasonal purchasing behavior[cite: 59, 60, 61]. This results in three critical issues:

1.  [cite_start]**Significant Revenue Volatility:** Sales are heavily concentrated in festive seasons, leading to unpredictable cash flow and sharp revenue declines during off-season months[cite: 76, 77].
2.  [cite_start]**Inefficient Inventory Management:** The lack of a systematic stocking policy causes overstocking of slow-moving items and stockouts of high-demand products, blocking capital[cite: 80, 81].
3.  [cite_start]**Sub-optimal Transportation Logistics:** A reactive and unplanned delivery process leads to inefficient routes, excessive fuel consumption, and potential service delays[cite: 83, 84].

---

## üöÄ Project Objectives

To address the problems, this project aims to achieve the following quantifiable goals:

* [cite_start]**Revenue:** Design and validate a strategy to **increase average monthly sales during non-festival seasons by 15%** within six months of implementation[cite: 78].
* [cite_start]**Inventory:** Develop a dynamic inventory model to **reduce overall holding costs by 10%** and **minimize stockouts of key items to less than 5%**[cite: 82].
* [cite_start]**Logistics:** Streamline transportation operations to achieve a **15% reduction in delivery-related costs** and improve the **on-time delivery rate to over 95%**[cite: 85].

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

[cite_start]A three-pronged analytical approach will be used to tackle each objective[cite: 63].

### 1. Revenue Stabilization
* **Methods:**
    * [cite_start]**RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** for customer segmentation and targeted promotions[cite: 105].
    * [cite_start]**Market Basket Analysis** to identify product associations for bundling and cross-selling[cite: 106].
    * [cite_start]**Sales Forecasting** using a Moving Average model to set a performance baseline[cite: 107].
* [cite_start]**Data:** Transactional sales data from July 2024 to July 2025 (Transaction_ID, Customer_ID, Date, Product_SKU, Quantity, Price)[cite: 108, 109].

### 2. Inventory Optimization
* **Methods:**
    * [cite_start]**ABC-XYZ Analysis** to create a multi-criteria inventory classification matrix based on revenue contribution and demand volatility[cite: 113, 114, 115].
    * [cite_start]**Reorder Point (ROP) Calculation** to determine optimal stock levels for high-value items[cite: 116].
* [cite_start]**Data:** Historical product sales data, supplier lead times, and item costs from July 2024 to July 2025[cite: 117].

### 3. Logistical Enhancement
* **Methods:**
    * [cite_start]**Grid-Based Zone Analysis** to group daily deliveries into geographical zones[cite: 122].
    * [cite_start]**Nearest Neighbor Heuristic** to determine an efficient delivery sequence within each zone[cite: 123].
    * [cite_start]**Cost-Benefit Analysis** to compare the in-house delivery model against outsourcing[cite: 124].
* [cite_start]**Data:** Delivery logs, vehicle expense reports, and quotes from local logistics providers[cite: 125].

---

## üíª Technology Stack

The analysis for this project will be conducted using the following tools:

* [cite_start]**Python:** For data manipulation, modeling, and analysis[cite: 110].
    * [cite_start]**Pandas & NumPy:** For data processing and quantitative analysis[cite: 110, 119, 127].
* [cite_start]**MS Excel:** For initial data structuring and the cost-benefit model[cite: 118, 126].

## üóìÔ∏è Project Timeline

[cite_start]The project is executed over an 11-week timeline, broken down into three main phases[cite: 63, 131]:

1.  [cite_start]**Initiation & Planning:** (Approx. Sep 2025) - Talking to the owner, submitting the project proposal, and collecting data[cite: 133, 147].
2.  [cite_start]**Analysis & Mid-Term Reporting:** (Approx. Oct 2025) - Data cleaning, insight generation, and mid-term submissions[cite: 134, 151].
3.  [cite_start]**Solution & Final Delivery:** (Approx. Nov 2025) - Finding solutions, preparing the final report, and Viva presentation[cite: 135, 155].

## ‚ú® Expected Outcomes

The successful implementation of this project is expected to deliver:

* [cite_start]**Enhanced Profitability:** Stabilized revenue streams and more predictable year-round cash flow[cite: 169, 170, 171].
* [cite_start]**Optimized Capital Allocation:** Reduced inventory holding costs and freed-up capital for reinvestment in high-demand products[cite: 172, 173, 175].
* [cite_start]**Increased Operational Efficiency:** Measurable cost savings in logistics and improved customer satisfaction through reliable, timely deliveries[cite: 176, 177, 178].
